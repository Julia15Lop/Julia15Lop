## Cloud & DevOps Engineer - Inspired by nature’s balance — automating with intention, scaling with care ✨🌱

# What I Bring to the Table

Cloud & DevOps Engineer with a master's CAP degree and vocational education in technology. I blend technical expertise with a teaching mindset to help engineering teams move faster and communicate better. From Kubernetes orchestation to technical documentation, I deliver results without compromising reliability. Inspired by nature, I build with intention and scale with care. 🤲

# 🔧 Core Expertise

🐳 Kubernetes, without the chaos

I deploy, scale and troubleshoot complex containerized environments keeping things smooth and reliable.

☁️ Multi-Cloud Architectures

Hands-on experience on GCP, AWS and Azure Cloud. I choose what fits best, not what's trending.

🔁 Infrastructure as Code

Terraform automation that eliminates repetitive work. I have cut manual operations by up to 80%.

🚀 CI/CD that actually helps

Workflows with automated testing and safe rollbacks. More shipping, less firefighting.

🔐 Security-first mindset

Zero Trust implementations and automated vulnerability management — built in, not bolted on.

📊 Observability with clarity

Full-stack monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and custom dashboards. If it breaks, you will know before it matters.
