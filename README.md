## Cloud & DevOps Engineer - Inspired by nature’s balance — automating with intention, scaling with care ✨🌱

# What I Bring to the Table

Cloud & DevOps Engineer with a master's CAP degree and vocational education in technology. I blend technical expertise with a teaching mindset to help engineering teams move faster and communicate better. From Kubernetes orchestation to technical documentation, I deliver results without compromising reliability. Inspired by nature, I build with intention and scale with care. 🤲

# 🔧 Core Expertise

🐳 Kubernetes, without the chaos

I deploy, scale and troubleshoot complex containerized environments keeping things smooth and reliable.

☁️ Multi-Cloud Architectures

Hands-on experience on GCP, AWS and Azure Cloud. I choose what fits best, not what's trending.

🔁 Infrastructure as Code

Terraform automation that eliminates repetitive work. I have cut manual operations by up to 80%.

🚀 CI/CD that actually helps

Workflows with automated testing and safe rollbacks. More shipping, less firefighting.

🔐 Security-first mindset

Zero Trust implementations and automated vulnerability management — built in, not bolted on.

📊 Observability with clarity

Full-stack monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and custom dashboards. If it breaks, you will know before it matters.

🎓 Teaching Makes Tech Better

With a background in education and a Master's degree in tech teaching, I bring a mindset of clarity, patience, and structure. I love sharing knowledge, mentoring junior engineers, and turning complex ideas into something simple and actionable.

# 🏆 Recent Achievements

* Orchestrated 70+ microservices for a ecommerce platform, reaching 99.9% uptime and high system resilience.
* Cut cloud costs by 25% through strategic resource optimization and cloud rightsizing.
* Tech with a Teaching Touch - I bridge the gap between building systems and helping others understand them. Whether it’s a Kubernetes cluster or a CI/CD workflow, I don’t just build. I document, explain, and empower.

# 💡 What Excites Me

Collaborating with teams that value both technical excellence and knowledge sharing.

I love environments where I can not only architect robust infrastructure and implement best practices, but also explain the "why" behind every decision. Helping others grow through clarity and context. 🤝

With a background in computer engineering and tech education, I bring a teacher’s mindset to engineering: I don’t just build systems; I make them understandable, scalable, and empowering. 💪

# 🌍 Currently Seeking

I’m currently open to **remote opportunities** as a **DevOps Engineer**, **SRE**, or **Platform Engineer**, within teams that value both **technical depth** and **clear communication**.

I'm especially drawn to **SaaS**, **fintech**, or infrastructure-heavy products — places where I can combine my experience in automation, Kubernetes, and cloud architecture with my **educator’s mindset**.

As a **computer engineer with formal training in technology education**, I don’t just build reliable systems — I help teams understand, maintain, and scale them with confidence.
